Steps to deploy the application


Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
Azure Account: Sign up for an Azure account if you don’t have one.
Node.js and NPM: Install Node.js and NPM on your local development environment.
Azure CLI: Install the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool.
Git: Make sure Git is installed on your machine.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Prepare Your Node/Express Application
Ensure your application is ready for deployment. Your package.json should include the necessary dependencies and a start script:
Your server.js (or equivalent) file should look something like this:
Set Up Your Azure App Service
Login to Azure: Open your terminal and log in to your Azure account using the Azure CLI:
Create a Resource Group: Organize your resources in Azure by creating a resource group:
Create an App Service Plan: Define the pricing tier and region for your app:
Create a Web App: Deploy your application to Azure:
Replace myUniqueAppName with a unique name for your app, and specify the Node.js version you want to use.
Deploy Your Application
Initialize a Git Repository: If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your application directory:
Set up Azure Deployment: Add Azure as a remote repository and push your code:
This command provides a Git URL. Add it as a remote repository:
If you are deploying from a branch other than main, replace main with your branch name.

Manage Your App
