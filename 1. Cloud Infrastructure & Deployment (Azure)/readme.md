Steps to deploy the application


Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
Azure Account: Sign up for an Azure account if you don’t have one.
Node.js and NPM: Install Node.js and NPM on your local development environment.
Azure CLI: Install the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool.
Git: Make sure Git is installed on your machine.

Step-by-Step Guide:
Prepare Your Node/Express Application
Ensure your application is ready for deployment. Your package.json should include the necessary dependencies and a start script:
Your server.js (or equivalent) file should look something like this:
Set Up Your Azure App Service
Login to Azure: Open your terminal and log in to your Azure account using the Azure CLI:
Create a Resource Group: Organize your resources in Azure by creating a resource group:
Create an App Service Plan: Define the pricing tier and region for your app:
Create a Web App: Deploy your application to Azure:
Replace myUniqueAppName with a unique name for your app, and specify the Node.js version you want to use.
Deploy Your Application
Initialize a Git Repository: If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your application directory:
Set up Azure Deployment: Add Azure as a remote repository and push your code:
This command provides a Git URL. Add it as a remote repository:
If you are deploying from a branch other than main, replace main with your branch name.

Manage Your App
Monitor Your Application: Use the Azure portal to monitor your app’s performance and set up alerts.
Scale Your Application: Adjust your app’s resources as needed from the Azure portal or via the Azure CLI:
Set Environment Variables: Configure environment variables from the Azure portal for secure access to API keys and secrets.

Enable Continuous Deployment: Connect your app to a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps for automated deployments.

Conclusion

Deploying a Node/Express application on Azure App Service is an efficient way to leverage cloud infrastructure while focusing on your application's code. Azure provides robust tools and integrations to help you scale and manage your app seamlessly. With the steps outlined above, you can get your application running in the cloud with minimal hassle.



Azure configurations used (Resource Groups, Networking, etc.)



Azure Configurations for Web App Deployment on Azure App Service
Below are the essential Azure configurations used to deploy a simple Node.js web application on Azure App Service:

1. Resource Group
Resource Group Name: my-webapp
A logical container for all the Azure resources (App Service, Database, Storage, etc.).
2. App Service Plan & App Service
App Service Plan: Defines the computing resources (pricing tier, region).
Example Configuration:
Name: my-app-service-plan
Region: East US
SKU: B1 (Basic Tier) (can be scaled as needed)
App Service: Hosts the web application.
Example Configuration:
Name: my-webapp
Runtime: Node.js 18 / Python 3.9
Public URL: https://my-webapp.azurewebsites.net/
3. Networking (Public Access & Security)
Virtual Network (VNet): Not required for basic setup (used for private networking).
Access Restrictions: Can restrict access to specific IPs if needed.
Custom Domain & SSL (Optional):
Configure a custom domain via Azure Front Door or Azure CDN.
Enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for secure communication.
4. Storage & Database (Optional)
Azure Storage (for static files, logs, etc.):
Name: mywebappstorage
Type: StorageV2 (general-purpose v2)
Replication: LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)
Azure SQL Database / CosmosDB (if needed for application data):
Name: my-webapp-db
Pricing Tier: Basic / Serverless
Connectivity: Public endpoint (secure with firewall rules)
