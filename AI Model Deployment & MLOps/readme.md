### **🔹 Step 1: Prepare the AI Model**  
Before deployment, ensure you have:  
✔ A **trained AI model** (e.g., `model.pkl`).  
✔ A **Flask API** that loads the model and provides a `/predict` endpoint.  
✔ A `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies.  

This API will be used to make predictions when deployed in a containerized environment.  

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Create a Dockerfile**  
A **Dockerfile** is a script that defines how to package the AI model and API into a **Docker container**.  

✔ Select a **base image** (e.g., Python 3.9).  
✔ Copy necessary files (model, API script, dependencies).  
✔ Install dependencies (e.g., Flask, joblib).  
✔ Set the API to run when the container starts.  
✔ Expose a **port** for communication (e.g., port 5000).  

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Build & Push the Docker Image**  
Once the **Dockerfile** is ready, you need to:  

✔ **Build the image**: This converts the application into a runnable **Docker image**.  
✔ **Tag the image**: Assign a unique identifier (e.g., `yourusername/my-ai-model:latest`).  
✔ **Push to Docker Hub**: Upload the image to a **container registry** like Docker Hub, so Kubernetes can fetch it later.  

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Define Kubernetes Deployment & Service**  
To run the AI model on Kubernetes, you need two configuration files:  

1️⃣ **Deployment File**:  
- Specifies how many **replicas** (instances) of the model should run.  
- Defines the **container image** and which **port** it listens on.  

2️⃣ **Service File**:  
- Exposes the deployed model to the outside world.  
- Uses **LoadBalancer** to provide an external IP for accessing the API.  

These configurations allow Kubernetes to manage and scale the application.

---

### **🔹 Step 5: Deploy on Kubernetes**  
Once the YAML files are ready, the deployment process involves:  

✔ **Applying the deployment configuration** using `kubectl`.  
✔ **Verifying the running pods** to ensure the model is live.  
✔ **Checking the external IP** of the service to access the API.  

---

### **🔹 Step 6: Test the API**  
After deployment, test the model by sending a **POST request** to the `/predict` endpoint using:  

✔ **cURL** (command-line) or **Postman** (GUI).  
✔ Sending a sample input to get a **prediction response**.  

If the response contains the expected output, the deployment is successful! 🚀  

---

### **✅ Deployment Completed!**  
At this stage, your **AI model is running in Kubernetes** and accessible via an external API.
